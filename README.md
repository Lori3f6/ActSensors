# ActSensors

Custom tags/objectives interfaces.

## Interfaces supported

_For easier identification, all names generated by plugin has a `+` prefix(e.g. tag or obj name `+flying`/`light_block` in game). It will not be specifically noted below._
_Indicators below are **read only**, and automatically update every tick._

_`hashed id` is a kind of numerical representation of alphabetical name or id. It will be generated at runtime. It might be slightly different between mc versions, which is unpredictable but tried to avoid. They will be generated as text file to `plugins/ActSensors/enumIDTables` folder while plugin initializing._
_You could also check hashed id [here](https://github.com/Lori3f6/ActSensors/hashedID). The number after letter `c` in the middle of the filename indicates times of hash collision when generating the id table. Some (but very few)  item id might change between table with different collision numbers(between mc versions)._

### Player Value Modifiers

_Modifiers are interface to modify internal value of the server, which is hard to modify by native commands.   
You could write a value in valid range to corresponding objectives, and the internal game value will be updated at next
tick._
